### Overview:
For our final project, we created a clicker/egg-hatching and pet-selling game where a user clicks an egg to hatch it and receive a randomized pet. To go into more detail: a user starts with 100 credits and can buy one egg, which they then bring to the hatching area through our dashboard. By clicking the egg 100 times, they hatch it. Midway through, the egg enters a cracked phase to indicate progress. There’s also a progress bar below so users can track their clicks if they prefer. After the egg hatches, the user can sell their pet to earn more coins and continue the cycle of buying eggs and collecting more pets. Some pets are rarer than others, so you’re more likely to get fish and forest wildlife in many draws, while rare pets, such as a Bubble Pet, appear less frequently.
The only thing to note before using our website is that you must have an egg to proceed with hatching, and a user can hold only one egg at a time. That means you can’t buy multiple eggs and run them through the hatching area simultaneously; instead, you have to buy an egg, hatch it, then go back and buy another. We used CSS styling, Express, and Node with nodemon, which lets us automatically see page updates in VS Code without restarting the server, speeding up development. We also connected to MongoDB.
Our biggest challenge was merging everyone’s code. Each of us implemented features a little differently, which led to many merge conflicts and a time-consuming process to unify everything into a single usable site. We all completed our assigned tasks; it was the final combination step that caused most of the issues. Emma created much of the pixel art, the hatching HTML page, and front-end JS. Eliza also contributed pixel art, handled the store page, and front-end JS. Matthew organized the team, managed GitHub, did much of the back end, and built the My Pets page. Nicholas implemented the sign-up and login screens and contributed to the back end. We built a comprehensive navbar with a detailed dashboard that explains each on-page variable, which is helpful for users who prefer clearly labeled information. We chose a dark theme as the default to keep the UI comfortable and usable in most settings.
